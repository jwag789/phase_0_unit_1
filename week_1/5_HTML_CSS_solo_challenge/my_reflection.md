I didn't ask many questions because again, I have dealt a lot with HTML and CSS. I do sometimes get confused about the space that margins and padding brings, and what happens when you layer divs, although I cleared this up by practicing during this challenge.

I always had a little trouble with my footers, but I realized how easy it was to get my footer to the bottom by simply clearing both sides. I also wasn't sure when to use inline blocks or if I should simply float my objects to the left and right. It seems this is a good way to go when you have a simple sidebar and content area. Also, the fact that psuedo selectors for links have to be in a certain order was important to find out. Hover must come after 'link' and visited, and active must come last.

I didn't learn much new besides refreshing myself on all of the terms and exactly what things like absolute and relative positioning did, although I already basically knew that. I am definitely confident with the learning comptetencies for this challenge and could easily build many more simple web pages like this. I found it enjoyable customizing my own web page and putting on content. Something I wasn't sure about in the directions, which would have made things tedious, is if some of the editing had to be done in the HTML file rather than the CSS file. The instructions mention adding width/height/center etc. information to the HTML page which would be much more tedious than adding this information to the CSS file, which is what I have done as I was unsure.
