Almost everything makes sense to me in the about HTML. I have been working with HTML and CSS for several years now, so there aren't really any surprises. I understand doctype, head and body sections, how to link to a CSS page, different tags, etc. The good thing about HTML is that it is a simple markup language to allow you to construct your website from top to bottom. A bad thing about it is that it isn't extremely customizable, which is fixed with other languages such as CSS and JavaScript. The only "aha" moment I had was the difference between CSS classes and IDs, realizing that multiple classes can be used by one section, and they can be used for multiple sections, while an ID is used for one section and only one ID can be used per section.
