# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

Web standards are a good guideline for web developers and designers. It focuses on accessability and usability of web pages, and recommends certain design practices and standard languages and techniques to use. For example, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., a lot of which are endorsed by the W3C. Also, techniques such as using min-width and max-width to work for different sized screens, and a 'reset CSS' to reset all default font sizes and such. I think web standards is a great way to get everyone on the same page. No matter what computer you are working on, web standards allows you to design for any kind of resolution. It gives you a good guideline of things to do to make your website functional and viewable for everyone.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

I'm trying to figure out exactly what this question is asking. The standard structure of a website generally makes sense to me though. Using HTML as a markup language with CSS to design, and JavaScript to make interactions all makes sense to me. The DOM is something that seems a little more complex, but more or less I understand that it connects different languages together on the web, so that HTML pages can read JavaScript, for example. The standards for different reset CSS and tips for getting your web page up on any screen all make sense to me too.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

At first, I didn't understand what the difference would be between writing say a div for a header, or writing out the new semantics instead. But after looking back at some of my old code I remembered how I would get confused when so many divs start to pile up. Using semantics, it's much easier to read through your code and see where section beginnings and endings match up. It's a good way to break down code and increases readability by a lot.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Certain HTML elements have their own default styles. With different browsers having their own default stylesheets as well, it is good to use a reset.css so that your website will look most similar across all platforms. A reset.css literally resets all of the default styles back to 0, with no bullets, no padding, etc. and is really good to get a clean slate when building a website without worrying about what styles might be for a specific browser.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I mostly use Google Chrome these days, but I used to use Firefox and before that Safari. Before that, IE. (I switched from Windows to Mac a few years ago, and then back to Windows...) Every browser certainly has their own style, and things do look different, whether its a slight padding or margin change, or fonts looking differently. I think it's generally a bad thing that the browsers have such different styles. It makes it harder as a designer to make something that looks nice across the board. I've had to use lots of fixes and hacks in the past to make something look good for all browsers, and it just becomes tedious.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
