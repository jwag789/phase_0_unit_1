I learned that there is a difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. The web is really what you would call the collection of websites that one can view on their web browser. The internet however is the all encompassing network of computers and servers that connect everyones files. I also learned that the difference between what is considered a webpage and a web app is that a webpage is mostly static with HTML, CSS, and some Javascript, while a web app is typically more dynamic with server-side code. I also found it interesting how services that sell domain names get their licenses from ICANN, a nonprofit from the U.S. government.

When setting up your HTML site, it is important to remember your hosting, your domain nameservers, and your DNS servers if you want to ever transfer your domain. It's also important to remember what you are using for your top level domain (such as .com or .net). Sometimes it could be used to your advantage such as setting up a site named 'www.glorio.us'

When I saw my web page live I thought it was pretty cool, just because I have never done that through github before. I've built a number of webpages before, so the rest was nothing new to me, but using the github app to commit and sync my changes was incredibly easy; easier than using an FTP program, for example.

Some "aha" moments were why DNS changes take so long, because of the requests only happening in certain times of the day. Also reading the difference between websites and web apps was very clarifying, and will help down the road when I decide what I want to be building. I didn't look at any other resources currently, but I found the smashingmagazine.com Intro to DNS very informative.
