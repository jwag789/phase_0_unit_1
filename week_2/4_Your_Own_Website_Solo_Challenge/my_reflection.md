# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://jwag789.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

It's hard for me to exactly explain what I recently learned about design and user experience. Having graduated with a degree in graphic design, I've learned plenty about the subject. Transferring that knowledge into a web page is interesting though. While making my web page I wanted to make sure that it was very simple and clean and that it didn't bog the user down with so many choices. I like the idea of a top-down web page where the user simply scrolls down to find everything they need in a clean, orderly fashion. Learning more about user experience got me thinking about how a user will view my web page on different widths and devices, and so I plan to implement media queries soon enough to fix any changes that happen during a size shift.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I do indeed love working with design, which is why I studied it in school. I'm slightly more used to print design although I've worked with web before several times. Visualizing an idea is great fun, but actually implementing it in code is slightly more of a proccess. It can be difficult to get exactly what you envisioned and so sometimes I had to change around something in my plan or mess with the CSS in such a way to fit my vision. Working on the plan and wireframe was slightly tedious to me, as I knew I would be changing the layout around while I worked, but it was nice to have some kind of visual guide.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

My process after making a plan and wireframe was to basically go into my HTML and CSS files and add one element at a time. It worked for the most part, putting in my header and then different sections and then the footer. Sometimes I would have to add in a section later on, and then things got messy because I am working with percentages in size and so I would have to factor that in when I would layer new sections. I then basically built a simple version of the web page, and after that I added colors, link styles, etc.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

So far I'm fairly happy with the look and color scheme of my web page, but I do want to add more content. I'm not sure if I want to add more to the "Welcome" page (maybe some kind of news scroller) or if I want to add a new section or two as you scroll down (under the Week1/Week2 links, for example) like a news section, or images or something. Once my skills increase I'll know better what I want to add.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It was not super difficult to apply the material as I already had a general knowledge of these topics and I made my website rather simple and visually clean. I wanted to add more features like psuedo elements for before, and after, but I have yet to find something exactly to use that for. But implementing the plan I already had was rather easy, and besides a few bugs I got originally from the margins and such, everything went as planned.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
