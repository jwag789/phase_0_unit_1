* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository on GitHub, simply navigate to the /new page type in its name, pick if its public or private, and pick a license (if any). To clone a repository, find it in the GitHub section of your GitHub desktop application, and click on Clone. While setting up a repository, picking a license is important, as it will decide what people can do with your code. Open source is when you share your programs code so anyone can see it and do what they want with it. Different licenses have different stipulations such as what exactly other people can do with your code and if you can use code bits on different projects.

I think that it is a really great idea and I'm really glad that it's become such a popular practice. I think that sharing code is a great way for people to learn and improve the code along with their skills.

The concepts soldified were how to create a repository, how to clone one, what exactly open source is, and what different licenses do. My "aha" moment would be the importance of using a license to decide if your file is open source or not and what people can do with it. I also now know better how open source works and benefits people. I did however struggle while trying to clone the repository through the command line. I came to the conclusion that I might not have been using the proper SSH keys or I didn't connect something correctly, which I'll be looking into. I was reading this page on it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12940626/github-error-message-permission-denied-publickey which is giving me ideas on what went wrong.
