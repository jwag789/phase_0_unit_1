Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

While talking with the people in my accountability group, I realized that we typically shared the same fears. We all know we are in for a crazy ride, and all of us seem to be very excited. This week so far has been strange settling into this new environment, even if it is just the beginning. We've all been setting up intro sessions and group sessions already and have all begun a real stream of communication, and the school hasn't even started for another 2 months. I found that surprising, as I wasn't expecting that kind of communication with other people just yet, but I was pleasantly surprised, because doing this other people who are in a similar situation to me makes me relieved and even more excited.
