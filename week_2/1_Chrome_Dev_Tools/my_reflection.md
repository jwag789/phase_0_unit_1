# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

	Reading about the DOM was interesting. I've heard the term before but I never understood it. While reading, it seemed like it did things that I never thought about before, but are essential for a web page. It's basically an interface for HTML and XML, and allows you to connect your web page to scripts and programming languages. Trying to figure out 'exactly' how it works is a little difficult for me, though. Reading on, I learned that the DOM defines a web page as a document, and that everything inside it is an object. It says that objects are nested in each other, and it defines the relationships. The DOM allows you to create events, properties and methods on your web page. The DOM seems like a good way to connect different languages and files together. It seems as if JavaScript was tied into DOM which I think is limiting if other languages aren't as accepted to use with it, but it seems that by now you can do that.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

	The two websites looked very different in the Chrome Web Tools. My website is incredibly simple in comparison. You can read every line of HTML with ease and the CSS is minimal. Everything is straightforward, with just one CSS page. The Wordpress page I looked at had many more CSS pages, along with XML pages, all kinds of meta tags, JavaScript files... In fact, a majority of the website is being linked from other files into the HTML file. Most of the content on the main page is really being fed into the file through JavaScript, and there are all sorts of things going on that I don't understand just yet.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

	I think it's a really helpful tool, one that I've already used before while working on some websites in the past. It definitely comes in handy if you want to visualize a quick change or see what might be causing an error. I don't really find it a pain to work with. It does clutter up the browser a bit but that's necessary.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

	I didn't realize how much you could do with the Web Tools, even though I've used them before to play around with the HTML and CSS. I didn't know about the timeline however, and I found it really interesting that I can see how long each element takes to load, and in what order. I found 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	While trying to find out 'bad' things about the DOM I looked at this website:

	Although there were many differing opinions on the DOM, there some interesting insights on it that I read there.
