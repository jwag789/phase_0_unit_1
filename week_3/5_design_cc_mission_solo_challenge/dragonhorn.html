	<h1>The Dragon Horn</h1>
	<p>The king has died mysteriously, and with various claims to the throne,
		the people decide to hold an election on who should be the next king. 
		As you were the king's younger brother, it's between you, you're younger
		brother, and your niece, along with a few other high lords. You know what
		you need to rally everyone to your side - the legendary Dragon Horn, which
		has the power to tame dragons and bring your people to greatness. But when
		you take the podium, do not blow the horn yourself! Ask your troop, Cragorn
		to blow it for you, for whoever blows this horn dies. But then, the throne is yours...</p>
