## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I didn't have many troubles while setting up git and GitHub. They were both very intuitive and easy due to the clear step by step instructions. While installing both, I was wondering if and how the two were being connected, but as I read it seems that you must create a pathway to directly connect the two accounts.

The difference between git and GitHub that I took away was that git seems to be a local version control system, where you can commit or 'take snapshots' of your files. When you want to modify the files, you check out the files, and then check them back in once you are satisfied and want to update. This is a great way to view the different versions of your files over any amount of time. GitHub stores your files online, allowing to collaborate very easily with others, and seeings everyones individual updates.

Version control is a way of maintaining the different versions of a project throughout its process, which is great for going back and looking through the history of a project. This could be beneficial when trying to understand a bug or see the development of a piece of code. GitHub helps with this by saving different snapshots of your code that you can view. It allows multiple collaborators to work on code at the same time. It makes sense to me why develepors would use version control, because its a great way to keep organized and track progress of a project since its creation.

I am still fuzzy on a couple of things probably because I have not yet used git or GitHub much, but this should change soon. I wonder how exactly I can view all of the different versions of a file although I'm sure it's apparent. Also some of the terms seem odd to me, and I had to read a few times to understand the basic commands. What makes sense to me however is that version control and git is important and GitHub is a great way to work with others
