        <a name="p1"></a><h2>Having Eachother's Back</h2>
        <p>When you pair program, you're not alone. When you code alone, you have to be the driver and navigator. In the role of driver, you can get so caught up in the moment that you lose track of the big picture---or maybe even the last line you typed. When you're driving with a navigator, you know they're keeping an eye on both of those things, and more. When you mess up, or go down the wrong path, the navigator is there to catch it and point it out. They also actively guide you to your mutual destination.</p>
        <a name="p2"></a><h2>Empathy</h2>
        <p>Empathy is a big part of pair programming. Engineering empathy is important because when partners communicate well it will lead to a better product. When both sides are open and empathetic to each others ideas and feelings, everyone learns and writes better. Shereef's fireside chat taught us all about the importance of empathy in pair programming. Understanding your partner and where they are coming from will be a big advantage when working with someone.</p>
        <a name="p3"></a><h2>Both Learning and Teaching</h2>
        <p>When you pair program, you simultaneously teach and learn. When coding and creating something, new challenges present themselves often. When you are working as a pair, you have the opportunity to both teach and learn, when appropriate. This spreads knowledge between the two people in the pair, filling in gaps, in an empowering way.</p>
        <a name="p4"></a><h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Working with a partner for the first time in a Guided Peer Session was really helpful, even if we were nervous beforehand. Once we began speaking with each other, and checking in with each other, we became comfortable enough to open up to each other about our ideas and work proccess. With two people on board rather than just working by yourself, a lot more can get done, as someone else is there to check your work and communicate with. We may have had our apprehensions of working in a pair beforehand, but we are starting to see now how it can definitely be helpful.
