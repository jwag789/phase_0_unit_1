## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I studied graphic design in college, so it's hard for me to say what I learned without going on in length. However, I never dove much into user experience, which I found pretty interesting. The act of mapping out a website and solving problems, from an indefinite route to a concise solution, was interesting to me, although it made a lot of sense. I had basically been doing that all informally, but seeing these explanations in writing made it seem that much more important. I enjoyed working on these wireframes actually, because it was simply some good design practice, and it was interesting to see these websites broken down into sections in a visual way.

I found a good resource for Wireframing which I really liked. There were a few, but this one seemed the most intuitive. The link is: http://framebox.org/

I didn't learn many new skills or tricks to be honest, but I will definitely remember what I read about user experience and wireframing, and will incorporate it into future designs. I am definitely confident with the Learning Competencies for this challenge, as this is something I've been studying for a while now.

Parts of the challenge I enjoyed was the wireframing and figuring out what problems each website was solving. I found it "tedious" or curious why we were asked to upload our images to a image hosting website to link in our HTML pages, rather than simply locally linking it.
