# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

	My biggest time management challenge was figuring out how I wanted to learn certain topics. The resources given by Dev Bootcamp are incredibly helpful, but when I want to go further or decide which one of their optional resources I should look into, I am always finding myself double guessing my choice. I wonder if another resource will be better and more efficient. For example, when learning about building a responsive web page, I was torn between reading the articles given on the subject, or watching the Team Treehouse videos and doing the example problems.

* How will you combat that? 

	To combat problems like that, I will try and think about my learning style and what might be the best for me. My learning style was mostly kinesthetic, so by me carrying out an activity by actually doing it, I know I will get the most out of it. That is why I ended up choosing to do the Team Treehouse problems. That is much more effective for me than reading an article. I will always be mindful of this and other factors in the future when deciding what resource to dive into.

* What techniques will you try?

	Mentioning mindfulness again, I will always try to be mindful of different factors. This includes my sleeping habits, my daily habits, and everything that affects my study process. By being mindful, you will become more aware of what is happening to you and what changes are taking place. Also after reading, I plan on getting into meditation. Apparently this gets rid of all beta waves in your brain that will clog productivity and it increases your memory, compassion, creativity, and of course, your focus. I will also mostly try and break my problems down into small things, and not worry about the big picture. By micro-managing your problems like that, there is less stress and more potential to grow and learn, one problem at a time.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	My overall plan for Phase 0 is to continue building up my knowledge of the subject. Phase 0 is broken up into sections very well, with different units, and weeks, and different sections per week. This helps me divide my time between different projects. I typically try and make a plan by reading about what we have to do for each week, and then creating a schedule on how to complete all of those tasks. I will continue to do this but I will also be mindful not to get overstressed or overworked just yet. I want to remain stress free, but that doesn't mean I won't work hard. I am going to try and learn as much as I can, but when I am having a problem with something, I will try and walk away for a few minutes, and try again. If I am spending too long on a problem, I will find another problem to do in the meantime and go back to it.
