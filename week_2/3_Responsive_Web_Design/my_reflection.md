# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is when a website is scalable and looks different depending on screen size and device. Instead of using pixels, which is an exact measurement used for fixed websites, a responsive website is built on a fluid grid, which uses percentages, and em's instead of pixels. It also uses media queries to change the CSS at certain browser widths. I think it's a good practice for many websites, although not always necessary. However it has the potential to increase usability and user experience, and is very helpful. Scalable images look wonderful, and by changing column sizes or anything with media queries, you can make a website look good at any size. My only issue is that something things get lost or moved around to fit different sizes, which can be good many times but can sometimes be a sacrifice.

Smartphones and tablets have certainly changed web design because it changed the way many people visit the web. People are using them more often, and especially now that tablets are popular and there are many various screen sizes, it's good to have adaptable, responsive websites. In the future I think technology will maybe change to make it easier to target a great variety of screen sizes, since there are so many different ones these days.

Visually impaired people use the web in a different way. With certain screen readers and Braille devices, there are ways to translate text on a website into audio or Braille. But navigating a website would be a challenge. A design could be implemented such as using the directional arrow keys to navigate rather than scrolling. By setting different events at different sections, each button pressed can lead to a new message and prompt.

A number of things have resonated with me while learning about web and design these past couple of weeks. Making web pages responsive really resonated with me because to me, they look much better, especially across different platforms. Also different techniques like using psuedo elements (before, and after) and using local fonts were helpful. I thought the DOM was interesting to, connecting your HTML files to JavaScript and other languages. The Google Dev Tools is also very helpful. I've used it before to play around with HTML and CSS but learning how to see timelines and fix errors was very helpful. I'm still having trouble with certain CSS features like float and clear but when I test them I usually find the right solution after a few tries. Also, I'm having difficulty understanding the exact different between an "adaptive" and "responsive" website. They seem to do pretty much the same thing to me.
