// My role in the group is: Person 1 - Translate tests into user stories

// Here is my part of the challenge:

// Test 1 - I want to make a program named sum so that I can find the sum of any group of numbers
// Test 2 - I want to make a program named sum able to sum up an odd amount of numbers
// Test 3 - I want to make a program named sum able to sum up an even amount of numbers
// Test 4 - I want to make a program named mean that will find the average of any group of numbers
// Test 5 - I want to make a program named mean able to find the average of an odd amount of numbers
// Test 6 - I want to make a program named mean able to find the average of an even amount of numbers
// Test 7 - I want to make a program named median that will find the median of any group of numbers
// Test 8 - I want to make a program named median able to find the median of an odd amount of numbers
// Test 9 - I want to make a program named median able to find the median of an even amount of numbers

// This was an interesting experience and it was good to work as a group for practice. It was definitely interesting,
// and was slightly hard scheduling everything between four people, but it was nice working together on a common
// goal. At first I wasn't really sure what to write for the user storis, but as I did a little research I understood
// better, and understood the benefits. As person 1, I did release 4 and tested the final code, and all of the tests
// passed. It was cool seeing the process from user stories to psuedocode to initial code to refactored code. It made
// the process more understandable to me in terms of breaking down and understanding what to do, especially when
// working with multiple people.
